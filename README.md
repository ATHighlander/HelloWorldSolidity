# HelloWorldSolidity
This is the first smart contract built in the "Become a Blockchain Developer" Learning Path taught primarily by Michael Solomon on the LinkedIn Learning Platform.
Mr. Solomon goes over building this project in Chapter 6 of this learning path.
This repository is meant to help those who were following along his tutorial but get confused or stuck with compilation or deploying to their test networks.
Please follow along with the LinkedIn Learning tutorial if possible, however this repository may help explain a simply smart contract to any who follow the comments left in the HellowWorld.sol file.

The HelloWorld.sol smart contract's functionality is to simply return the string message "Hello World".

The accompanying HelloWorld.js migration's only task is to deploy HelloWorld.sol to the specified network.
The specified network in the truffle-config.js is the development network for a local Ganache network.
